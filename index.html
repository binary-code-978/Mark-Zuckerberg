            Today(October 29,2021) when I was making this Website Mark Zuckerburg changed Facebook's name to Meta, what
            a coincidence.<br>
            Facebook, the social network Zuckerberg runs, has been an information hub during the pandemic, but has come
            under scrutiny for spreading vaccine misinformation.<br>
            In June 2021, a judge dismissed antitrust cases brought by states and the federal government, which could
            have forced Facebook to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp.<br>
            Zuckerberg started Facebook at Harvard in 2004 at the age of 19 for students to match names with photos of
            classmates.<br>
            He took Facebook public in May 2012; he now owns about 12% of the company's stock.<br>
            In December 2015, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, pledged to give away 99% of their Facebook stake
            over their lifetimes.
